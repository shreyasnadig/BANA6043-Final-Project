# BANA6043-Final-Project
Sudden Cardiac Arrest Prediction

As the final project for my Statistical Computing class, I am working with with my classmates where we use patient record dataset to identify who are the potential subjects of Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA). We are using only a part of the patient history data and building multiple *prediction* models to accurately identify the SCA subjects. We first understand the data by cleaning and performing EDA to identify trends, then perform the necessary pre-processing and feature engineeing to bring the data to a 'model ready' format. This is followed by applying the models we have researched and selected to best fit the data we have and choose a model winner based on metrics such as Accuracy, Precission, Recall, F1-Score and Cross-Validation Accuracy.

Please refer to the attached PDF for complete analysis and results.
